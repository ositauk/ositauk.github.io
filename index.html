    <h2>Case Studies</h2>

    <div class="case-study">
      <h3>üöÄ Digital Branding Campaign for a Paper Company (Ausdauer Co.)</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> A regional paper company partnered with Ausdauer Co. to enhance its digital presence and drive B2B engagement through a new website and targeted social media campaigns.</p>
      <p><strong>Critical Impediments:</strong> Designers and developers worked in different time zones, causing delays in sign-off and feedback loops; the client frequently introduced scope changes mid-sprint; initial backlog items lacked sufficient detail, leading to ambiguity in sprint planning.</p>
      <p><strong>Task:</strong> As Scrum Master, I was responsible for enabling a cohesive and timely delivery by removing blockers, guiding the team through Agile ceremonies, and improving backlog clarity and workflow visibility.</p>
      <p><strong>Action:</strong> Facilitated Scrum ceremonies with cross-functional teams using MS Teams and Confluence; initiated mid-sprint alignment checkpoints to reduce surprises and scope creep; worked closely with the Product Owner to refine user stories and set WIP limits; established a protocol for backlog grooming that ensured clarity and consistency; coached the team on better estimation practices to adapt to evolving priorities.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Launched MVP website within 4 sprints (8 weeks); increased delivery confidence from 3.1 to 4.3 on internal feedback scores; digital campaign led to a 26% increase in website engagement and 15% rise in B2B inquiries within the first 60 days.</p>
      <p><strong>Retrospective:</strong> We learned that time zone mismatches needed more than async tools ‚Äî we added overlap hours and clear cutoffs for daily blockers. The project also highlighted the need for tighter sprint boundaries; I recommended a rolling backlog freeze after sprint planning for future marketing-integrated work.</p>
