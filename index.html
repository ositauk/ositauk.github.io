    <h2>Case Studies</h2>

    <div class="case-study" data-category="linil">
      <h3>üë• Visitors Management System (Linil Technologies)</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Linil was building a visitor registration and tracking system for mid-sized corporate offices. The product was being developed by distributed teams and included features like badge printing, pre-registration, and check-in analytics.</p>
      <p><strong>Critical Impediments:</strong> Remote team members worked in 3 time zones, causing delays in feedback and handovers; conflicting requirements from different client sites led to scope creep; no standardized approach to backlog grooming across teams.</p>
      <p><strong>Task:</strong> As Scrum Master, I needed to unify delivery cadence, improve team alignment, and ensure backlog health across distributed squads.</p>
      <p><strong>Action:</strong> Facilitated asynchronous stand-ups via Slack and introduced overlap hours for sprint planning; created a shared Confluence knowledge base with process flowcharts, DoD, and WIP policies; established cross-team refinement sessions and a rotating ‚Äúbacklog curator‚Äù role; implemented a ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs blocking you?‚Äù board to identify recurring cross-team impediments.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Reduced blocker resolution time by 55% after standardizing dependency tracking; increased velocity consistency across teams within 3 sprints; product was adopted by 3 clients within 1 quarter of launch.</p>
      <p><strong>Retrospective:</strong> Distributed teams need more than tooling ‚Äî they need rituals that create shared rhythm. For future distributed projects, I recommend formalizing async rituals and building in redundancy for backlog ownership.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-study" data-category="linil">
      <h3>üè´ Academic Information System (Linil Technologies)</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> The team was tasked with building a modular academic platform for private primary and secondary schools. The system included attendance tracking, report generation, and parent communication modules.</p>
      <p><strong>Critical Impediments:</strong> School-specific feature requests led to frequent backlog reshuffling; stakeholders had limited digital experience, affecting feedback clarity; dependencies between reporting and grading modules slowed delivery.</p>
      <p><strong>Task:</strong> As Scrum Master, I needed to streamline feature delivery and shield the team from scope volatility while enhancing stakeholder collaboration.</p>
      <p><strong>Action:</strong> Grouped user stories into release-focused epics tied to business outcomes; introduced a visual roadmap in Jira to align stakeholders on priorities; coached the Product Owner on managing stakeholder communication; encouraged pairing between backend and frontend devs to resolve integration friction.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Delivered a functional MVP in 5 sprints covering 3 core modules; maintained team focus with only 1.2 story carry-overs per sprint; platform adoption grew to 8 schools within 2 months of launch.</p>
      <p><strong>Retrospective:</strong> This project reinforced the importance of Agile literacy among stakeholders. We created a mini ‚ÄúAgile 101‚Äù onboarding deck to use in future client engagements to align expectations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-study" data-category="linil">
      <h3>üí≥ Payment Platform API Integration (Linil Technologies)</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Linil was contracted to develop RESTful APIs to integrate third-party payment platforms for use across multiple product offerings.</p>
      <p><strong>Critical Impediments:</strong> Third-party APIs lacked documentation, causing delays during integration; regulatory changes mid-project impacted endpoint requirements; QA team struggled to simulate test environments across payment gateways.</p>
      <p><strong>Task:</strong> As Scrum Master, I supported a fast-moving engineering team responsible for architecture, endpoint design, and sandbox testing.</p>
      <p><strong>Action:</strong> Established clear DoD for API user stories, including logging, auth, and versioning; facilitated coordination with third-party providers to close knowledge gaps; coached QA team to define test strategy using mocks and stubs; partnered with Product Owner to set realistic story points during uncertainty.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Delivered stable APIs in 4 sprints, with zero post-deployment incidents; improved test coverage by 60% after QA process overhaul; enabled integration with 3 payment platforms across 2 client apps.</p>
      <p><strong>Retrospective:</strong> When working with external dependencies, proactive communication is key. I now embed integration checkpoints into our sprint reviews to catch issues early.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-study" data-category="rainbow">
      <h3>üìä SAP Business One Rollout ‚Äì Requirements Analysis (Rainbow Town)</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Rainbow Town wanted to improve operational efficiency across HR, Inventory & Stock Control, and Finance. There was no unified digital system and several manual bottlenecks.</p>
      <p><strong>Critical Impediments:</strong> Lack of documentation on current processes; resistance from department heads during information gathering; multiple conflicting pain points across departments.</p>
      <p><strong>Task:</strong> As a Requirements Analyst, I was responsible for capturing business needs and identifying solutions to digitize operations.</p>
      <p><strong>Action:</strong> Led stakeholder interviews and mapped workflows; recommended SAP Business One as a unified platform; facilitated implementation and led training for end users; created documentation and SOPs for each department.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Improved inventory accuracy by 80%; reduced stockouts by 50%; increased HR reporting efficiency by 30%.</p>
      <p><strong>Retrospective:</strong> This was a turning point in appreciating the value of user-centric change management. I now approach technical transformations with an eye on people adoption, not just process design.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-study" data-category="ausdauer">
      <h3>üèóÔ∏è Website for a Steel Company (Ausdauer Co.)</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Ausdauer Co. was contracted to deliver a corporate website for a national steel manufacturer aiming to modernize its digital presence and support lead generation. The client had no previous digital infrastructure, and stakeholders had varying expectations around features and timelines.</p>
      <p><strong>Critical Impediments:</strong> Ambiguity around MVP scope led to confusion during sprint planning; stakeholders provided inconsistent input, requiring frequent backlog reprioritization; design approval delays created bottlenecks for frontend development.</p>
      <p><strong>Task:</strong> As Scrum Master, I was responsible for creating delivery focus, supporting backlog clarity, and ensuring that sprint ceremonies supported iterative progress despite shifting priorities.</p>
      <p><strong>Action:</strong> Collaborated with the Product Owner to re-define and lock in MVP features early; implemented weekly backlog grooming to adapt to client changes while minimizing disruption; facilitated stakeholder alignment workshops using Confluence to clarify goals and timelines; coached the team on vertical slicing to reduce dependency on late-stage design approvals; used Jira dashboards to increase transparency and build stakeholder confidence in progress.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Delivered the initial live website in 3 sprints, with additional enhancements deployed over two more; reduced average story rework by 35% after introducing tighter acceptance criteria; client feedback reflected a 95% satisfaction rate with delivery cadence and communication.</p>
      <p><strong>Retrospective:</strong> This project taught us the value of a Definition of Ready (DoR) for stories before they entered sprint planning. It also reinforced the importance of managing stakeholder expectations not just through reporting, but by involving them more actively in demos and backlog prioritization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-study" data-category="fahrenheit">
      <h3>üìÅ Unified Digital Asset Management for Government (Fahrenheit Information Solutions)</h3>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> The State Government commissioned Fahrenheit to deliver a centralized platform for managing digital assets (documents, media, data) across departments including finance, healthcare, and communications. Key components were controlled by independent third-party contractors such as the Revenue Service platform and the Rural Healthcare system, adding complexity to the integration process.</p>
      <p><strong>Critical Impediments:</strong> Lack of technical alignment with third-party contractors delayed key integrations; ministries provided inconsistent requirements and change requests mid-sprint; late-stage clarity on compliance and data privacy introduced rework during testing.</p>
      <p><strong>Task:</strong> As the Founder and acting Scrum Master, I was responsible for enabling structured Agile delivery, managing stakeholder relationships across ministries, and coordinating technical dependencies with third-party vendors.</p>
      <p><strong>Action:</strong> Led sprint ceremonies using Jira and remote facilitation tools like Skype, adjusting cadence to accommodate ministry and vendor schedules; built an integration board in Jira to track third-party deliverables and dependency blockers; worked with the Product Owner to develop security-focused user stories after compliance audits; facilitated backlog refinement sessions with non-technical stakeholders to improve feature clarity and prioritization.</p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Successfully launched the platform MVP within 12 weeks, with integrations from 3 ministries and 2 external vendors; reduced sprint scope changes by 40% through improved backlog grooming and stakeholder alignment; delivered a centralized platform that enabled 5+ departments to securely manage and audit their digital assets.</p>
      <p><strong>Retrospective:</strong> This project taught me the value of proactively managing external dependencies as part of the delivery ecosystem. I implemented an ‚Äúintegration checklist‚Äù for future projects involving third-party systems, and began including vendor updates as a fixed item in sprint reviews.</p>
